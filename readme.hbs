# Easy Sprite by ADS Medienmanufaktur
#### Merge your SVG files or raw SVG code into one concise and minimal sprite sheet and build your own SVG library :)

---
## Overview
This package allows you to edit a sprite sheet without even opening it... All right from within your code!
You only have to provide a sprite sheet to use. If the sprite does not exist it will be created.

## Notes on generated sprite sheet
All SVG code (including the code extracted from SVG files) will be optimized using [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
By default all Fills are remove to allow styling the icon with CSS. This results in unicolor icons (if the individual paths are not styled separately from the main SVG element.)
